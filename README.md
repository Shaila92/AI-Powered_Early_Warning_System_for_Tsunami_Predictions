**AI-Powered Early Warning System for Tsunami Predictions (UAE & Gulf Coast)**

This project combines Google Colab (Generative AI, Transformers, Physics-Informed Neural Networks) with Power BI Dashboards to simulate, predict, and visualize tsunami risks across the UAE and Gulf Coast.

**Project Overview**
This research-oriented project demonstrates how next-gen AI models can be used for disaster management and early warning systems.
Seismic + Buoy Data Preprocessing (NOAA & synthetic datasets)
Time-Series Transformer for wave prediction
Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) for enforcing ocean physics
Conditional GAN (cGAN) for generating synthetic tsunami waveforms
GeoGPT (LLM-based) for automatic emergency alert generation
Power BI Dashboard for visual analytics & risk KPIs

**Tech Stack**
Google Colab / PyTorch → Model training & simulations
Hugging Face Transformers (Flan-T5) → AI-generated alerts
Obspy → Seismic waveform handling
Plotly / Matplotlib / Seaborn → Visualizations
Power BI → Interactive dashboard

**Google Colab Implementation**

**Key modules:**
Data Preprocessing → Normalize seismic + buoy data
Time-Series Transformer → Predict tsunami wave height
PINN Loss → Enforce physical PDE constraints
Conditional GAN → Generate synthetic tsunami scenarios
GeoGPT → Natural language tsunami advisory alerts


**Example Output:**
⚠️ Emergency Advisory ⚠️  
A magnitude 7.8 earthquake near Oman trench has triggered a tsunami warning for UAE.  
Waves up to 3.5m expected within 45 minutes.  
Residents are urged to evacuate low-lying coastal areas immediately.  


**Bulid an Power BI Dashboard**
Interactive tsunami monitoring dashboard with real-time simulation results:
Geospatial Heatmaps – Tsunami propagation
Trend Analysis – Wave height predictions over time
Runup Severity Distribution – (Low, Medium, High) coastal impacts

**KPIs –**
Avg. predicted wave height
Number of alerts issued
Coastal locations at high risk
PINN residual error
Magnitude 
Forecast lead time before landfall


**Real-World Impact**
This project demonstrates how AI + Data Science + Visualization can support:
Early warning systems for disaster management
Decision-making tools for UAE/Gulf emergency authorities
AI-driven risk communication (English/Arabic tsunami alerts)
